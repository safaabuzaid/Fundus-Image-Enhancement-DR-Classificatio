Image Error Measurements
======================================
main executing reference usage: usage_errorMeasurementsOfImages.m
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective is to measure the differences between 2 images, and measurement of image quality.
1. Mean squared error, MSE
2. Root Mean squared error, RMSE
3. Peak signal to signal noise ratio, PSNR
4. Mean absolute error, MAE
5. Signal to signal noise ratio, SNR
6. Universal Image Quality Index
7. Enhancement Measurement Error, EME
8. Pearson Correlation Coefficient

Sample output:
--------------
PSNR = +13.81915 dB 
MSE = 108.53790 
RMSE = 10.41815 
Universal Image Quality Index = 0.16077 
EME (original image) = 14.50599 
EME (noisy image) = 8.48040 
PearsonCorrelationCoefficient (originalImage vs noisyImage) = 30959.27033 
PearsonCorrelationCoefficient (originalImage vs originalImage) = 50624.00000 
SNR = -10.28091 dB 
MAE = 19.82882
